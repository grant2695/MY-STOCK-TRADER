A MERN Stack virtual stock trading platform.

Built using the MERN stack(MongoDB,Express.js,React.js,Node.js)Developed for a coding assignment. I am very new to full stack development, having very little experience prior to this.

It is important to run npm install in both the root and client folders


DESIGN
I was asked to build a full stack web app to allow users to buy and sell stocks(with virtual money).Therefore,I was concerned with a few aspects from the beginning:

-User Authentication
-Accurate Stock Data
-Responsive Data Storage

For my stock data,I chose to use the [AlphaVantage API]due to its accessibility and minimum data requirements (daily)
